# Detect-Protein-Coelution-Community
Community detection is a cornerstone of network analysis, revealing groups of nodes (e.g., genes, proteins, or molecular complexes) that are highly interconnected. In biological systems, these communities often correspond to functional modules, pathways, or molecular systems critical to understanding cellular behavior. Despite advances in this area, accurately detecting and annotating communities in large-scale, noisy networks remains a significant challenge, particularly in systems biology.

Cell Maps for AI (CM4AI) is a collaborative program that integrates systems biology, artificial intelligence, and computational modeling to address pressing questions in biomedicine. By leveraging insights from community detection, CM4AI aims to enhance the interpretability of biological networks and identify actionable biological insights, such as disease pathways and potential therapeutic targets.
